## The AI-First Philosophy

**Old way (dying):** Memorize 500 git commands, master Docker CLI, read 500-page books.

**New way (2026):** Understand concepts, let AI generate commands, verify output works.

```
❌ DON'T: Memorize PostgreSQL CLI flags
✅ DO:   Know databases exist, ask AI to set one up securely

❌ DON'T: Spend weeks learning every Docker command
✅ DO:   Understand containers, let AI generate the config

❌ DON'T: Become the "person who knows one thing deeply"
✅ DO:   Become the "person who can ship anything with AI"
```

**Your core skills (AI-proof):**
1. Problem Decomposition — Break big problems into AI-solvable chunks
2. Architecture — Know what tools exist and when to use them
3. Verification — Check that AI's output actually works
4. Communication — Explain technical concepts to humans
5. Security Awareness — Know what's risky, let AI find/fix it

## Day 0: Setup (15 minutes)

```bash
# Install SOTA CLI tools (AI knows how to use these)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtgsystems/CO-OP/main/install-sota-tools.sh | bash

# Verify tools
eza --version    # Modern ls
bat --version    # Syntax-highlighted cat
rg --version     # Fast search (ripgrep)
```

See [SOTA_TOOLS_CHECKLIST.md](./SOTA_TOOLS_CHECKLIST.md) for the full 128+ tool list.
