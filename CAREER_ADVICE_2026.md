| **Entry Salary** | $70,000 - $95,000 |
| **Senior Salary** | $150,000 - $220,000 |
| **Demand Level** | Stable - Every business needs web presence |

### 2026 Web Stack Essentials

#### Frontend (Must Have)

| Technology | Why 2026 | Skill Level |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **TypeScript** | Non-negotiable for production | Expert |
| **React** | Still dominant ecosystem | Advanced |
| **Next.js 15+** | Default for new projects | Advanced |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Industry standard styling | Intermediate |
| **React Query** | Data fetching patterns | Intermediate |

#### Backend (Pick One)

| Stack | Best For | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Next.js API Routes** | Small apps, rapid development | Low |
| **Supabase + Edge Functions** | Database-heavy, real-time | Medium |
| **Node.js + Express** | Traditional REST APIs | Medium |
| **NestJS** | Enterprise, structured backends | High |

#### Emerging (Watch List)

- **Web3** - Smart contracts, but crypto is volatile
- **WebXR** - AR/VR in browser (Apple Vision Pro impact)
- **Edge Computing** - Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge
- **Server Components** - React Server Components default in 2026

### AI Integration in Web Dev (2026 Reality)

```
Before (2023):
npm create react-app
100+ files manually
No type safety
Slow iteration

After (2026):
vite create with AI scaffolding
AI generates components
TypeScript strict mode
Instant feedback + AI refactoring
```

**Your job changes from:**
- "Write this component" -> "Review AI's component and refine it"
- "Debug this error" -> "Explain this error to AI, verify fix"
- "Choose this library" -> "Evaluate trade-offs with AI research"

### Career Paths

```
